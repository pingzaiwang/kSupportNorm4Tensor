will be shown very soon.

We are very sorry for the mistakes and typos in the submimitted version of "Tensor Recovery via $*_L$ Spectral $k$-Support Norm". We have uploaded a new version  "tSkNorm-modification and proof.pdf" in which the following two mistakes have been corrected:
1) In the right hand side of Eq. (21), $\|r^*\|_{\infty}$ should be $\min_{l} r^*_l$. We have corrected this mistake and its relevant corrolaries. 
2) In Paragraph 2 of Page 5, the typos in the definitions of sets $I_1$ and $I_0$ have been corrected.
